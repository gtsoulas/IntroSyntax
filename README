This folder contains the source files for the slides and other material used in teaching first year syntax using Sportiche, Koopman and Stabler as textbook.

The slide sources are meant to be compiled with XeLaTeX and you will need to have the Fira Sans font family.  You will also need to use Norman Yeo's version of the linguex package (linguexsf.sty) to fix the fonts in examples.  The file is in this folder.
